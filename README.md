# AnnoyingHub
A hub for annoying software and scritps to be downloaded from.

## Finished programs/scripts
- Caps lock randomly getting activated or deactivated while typing
- Fake warning box with no option but to press "Yes" to restart. Doesn't actually restart the computer.

## Planned ideas are kept secret
We do not want others to copy our ideas before we have made them ourselves, and will therefore only discuss them once we are finished.
